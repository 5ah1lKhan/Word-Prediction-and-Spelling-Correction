This is a small sample corpus for testing the LSTM text generation workflow. 
It contains multiple sentences to provide some basic context for the model. 
Natural language processing tasks like text generation require sufficient data. 
Training on this small file will be quick but the results will not be meaningful. 
The primary goal here is to validate the code execution pipeline. 
Preprocessing should tokenize these words and create sequences. 
The model will attempt to learn patterns from this limited vocabulary. 
Generation will then use the trained model to produce new text based on a seed.
